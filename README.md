# TicTacToe
TicTacToe over a server using python

This project was originally a final assignment for a networking class, but I continiued working on it in my free time. Because of this project, I became more familiar with Python and high level networking concepts. I also built a computer player so that one person could play alone. The algorithm for the computer player is best described as a heuristic algorithm with 1 step lookahead.

For the computer player, I represented the board using binary numbers-one for Xs and one for Os. This approach allowed me to leverage the speed of binary calculations to significantly improve the computer player's decision-making process.
